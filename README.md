# Youtter
Redirect YouTube-URLs to a custom Yotter instance without sending a bit to YouTube. 
Yotter is a privacy friendly alternative/frontend of YouTube. It is available for Firefox here: https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/youtter/ 

The redirect of Twitter-URLs is coming soon, when the URL scheme of Yotter is the same as of Twitter.
