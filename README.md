# Youtter
Redirect YouTube-URLs to a custom Yotter instance without sending a bit to YouTube. Yotter is a privacy friendly alternative/frontend of YouTube. It is open source: https://github.com/ytorg/Yotter  The redirect of Twitter-URLs is coming soon, when the URL scheme of Yotter is the same as of Twitter.
